# Pre-requisites

A few Ubuntu instances with `ss` and `sudo` access

# Configure access to the instances

Fill your  `~/.ssh/config` and then edit `MASTER` `NODES`and `USER` in env.sh

```shell
MASTER="k8s-master-1"
NODES="k8s-node1 harbor-node2"

```

# Manage the cluster

```shell
# Create the cluster
./create.sh

# Reset the cluster
./reset.sh

# Connect to k8s
ssh k8s-master-1
kubectl get pods -A
```

# Go based CLI

The `kadmiral` command wraps these scripts and runs them in parallel over SSH.
Example usage:

```shell
kadmiral --nodes master1,node1,node2 --user root rsync
kadmiral prereq --os ubuntu
kadmiral init --node master1
kadmiral cni install cilium
kadmiral join node node2 --master master1:6443 --token <token> --ca-hash <hash>
kadmiral reset node2
kadmiral reset --all
```

The CLI uses SSH to copy the repository to each node and execute the relevant
scripts concurrently. Logging is provided via Go's `slog` with a `--log-level`
flag for controlling verbosity.
